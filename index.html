    <h3> Chelsea FC </h3>
 
    
    <h5> Chelsea Football Club (FC), nicknamed “the Blues,” is one of the world’s richest, biggest, and most-supported football clubs. It is known for its star players and an offensive style of play.
Chelsea FC was founded in 1905 by Henry Augustus Mears. Home games are played at Stamford Bridge stadium, the original site Mears chose for the club. The team had mixed fortunes over the years, not winning a major trophy until the 1950s and moving up and down between divisions several times. The Blues improved their standing in the 1990s and the early 21st century to become one of the most successful clubs in English football. They won English Premier League titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06, adding to their only previous league win, in 1954–55 (then in the Football League First Division), and making them the second English team to win consecutive championships since the founding of the Premier League in 1992. 
Chelsea added a fourth league title in 2009–10, setting a new Premier League record by scoring 103 goals over the course of the season, and it won additional league championships in 2014–15 and 2016–17. It took the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1971 and 1998 and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Super Cup in 1998. In 2012 the club claimed its first Champions League title. Chelsea FC also won the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) eight times.
